# useful_tools
A curated list of useful tools (mini-projects).

**Projects**:
- [scrape_hackernews](https://github.com/OAndris/useful_tools/tree/master/scrape_hackernews): Collect the articles from multiple Hacker News pages, filter and order them based on the number of votes, and output to a HTML page or to the console.
- [password_checker](https://github.com/OAndris/useful_tools/tree/master/password_checker) Reads passwords from "passwords.txt" (separated by newline) and checks whether they have ever been pwned, based on the "https://haveibeenpwned.com/" API. The safety of the passwords is protected in a number of ways.
